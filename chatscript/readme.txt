ChatScript is an open source natural language engine. But it is not completely open source. It is more a private project of mine that I share with the world. If you want to write code for it you can communicate with me and if it makes sense I will integrate it with the engine (perhaps rewriting aspects of it to be more consistent with the engine design and code). If you want to suggest features, you can email me at gowilcox@gmail.com. Many suggestions are implemented within a month if they seem useful. Bug reports ditto, they tend to get fixed within a week.  There is a user forum at chatbots.org/forums/ChatScript.

 
Check back monthly for revisions if you are actively using it.

This is a stand-alone LINUX or Windows chat engine that can also run as a high-performance server. Also runs on MAC/iOS/Android.
It contains an actual chatbot with a microscopic personality but an unlimited ability to quibble.
